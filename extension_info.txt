This is an extension of the HCI cookbook that provides the description of new content.
The original data set was extended as a part of the course Getting and Cleaning data.
=====================================================================================

The extended dataset contains the following new files:
======================================================

- 'projectVariables.txt': Subset of features (from 'features.txt') that participate in new analysis

- 'average_values.txt': Data set that contains the average of each variable (from 'projectVariables.txt') for each activity
  (from 'activity_labels.txt') and each subject (combined from 'test/subject_test.txt' and 'train/subject_train.txt').


Description of the file 'average_values.txt':
============================================

- 'average_values.txt' stores observations for 68 variables in 68 columns.

- Column 1 'Subject' identifies the subject who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- Column 2 'Activity' identifies the activity name. There are six possible activity names: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

- Columns 3-68 contain average values of variables defined in 'projectVariables.txt' for each subject and for each activity.
  Measurements for the analysis are taken from the original data sets 'test/X_test.txt' and 'train/X_train.txt'. Columns 3-68 are named according to the variable names as in 'projectVariables.txt'.

Notes:
======

- To improve the data set's readability, parentheses '()' and dash symbols '-' were removed from variable names while
naming corresponding columns in 'average_values.txt'. Thus, the column name that corresponds to variable
'tBodyAcc-mean()-X' is 'tBodyAccmeanX' and so on.
